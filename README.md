## Architecture
![MVC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/327cf6e1-eb17-4b62-bf66-128f9acaf6bf)

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a design pattern used in API development to organize code into three main parts, making the development process simpler and more reliable:

- **Model**: Manages the data and database interactions, such as storing and retrieving information.
- **View**: Prepares the data and sends it back to the client, often as JSON, so it can be used by the client-side application.
- **Controller**: Handles user requests, processes them, communicates with the model to get or update data, and passes the data to the view to send back as a response.
